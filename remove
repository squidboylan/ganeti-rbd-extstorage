"""Remove an existing rbd Image from a RADOS cluster

This program removes an rbd Image file from a RADOS cluster.
It takes it's input from environment variables. Specifically the

 - VOL_NAME: The name of the Image file to remove
 - POOL:     The RADOS pool in which the Image resides

Returns O upon successfull removal, 1 upon failure
